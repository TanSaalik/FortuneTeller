The Application uses sensors. Added comments to the code to describe what different methods do.

Overall the app gives you a response for your questions and thoughts. You either on the main screen tap the "record" button and ask you question. Or just think/ask your question and shake the device.

From the menu you can open a separate magic-8-ball where you can tap the "shake" that will shake for you. So you don't have to physically move yourself. Boom! Sold!

Added the speech recognition part from last lesson. It works in the means of opening and such, but as I haven't managed to set up my own device to test stuff on it, I don't actually know whether it does understand speech because I use emulator. Functionality side works though.
